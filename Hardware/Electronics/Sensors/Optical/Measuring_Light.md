# Measuring Light Intensity

Light intensity can be measured and expressed in a variety of ways. Let's shed some light on units used to measure light:

## Units to Express Light Intensity

There are different units to represent light intensity, such as *W/m2*, *Lux* and *Lumen*. They all measure light intensity, but they do so from different perspectives. So it is important to look at the appropriate unit when trying to get an answer:

* **Energy**: If you want to set up solar panels, you are interested in the pure physical energy that sunline can deliver. Thus *W/m2* is your choice.
* **Brightness**: If you want to buy a new lamp to illuminate your living room you are interested in how bright the room will be. Thus "Lux" is your choice.

Let's take a closer look at what the different units really express:

* **W/m2 (*"Irradiance"*, Energy per Surface*)**: The unit *W/m2* is often used to represent the physical energy emitted by a light source. So W/m2 is the *rate of energy* that falls on a defined *surface*. It is mostly used in the solar industry because it expresses for example the energy of sunshine that can be captured by a solar panel. It is not so much a good indicator for *"brightness*" because it does not take into consideration wavelengths (colors) of light. Since the human eye picks up different light wavelengths in a different way (and is most sensitive to green light for example), the "felt" brightness can be much different from the actual light energy. For example, UV light may be of high energetic intensitiy (take a tan lamp) yet the human eye would "feel" this light is not very bright or even completely dark (which is in essence why you should wear eye protection when tanning because even though the UV lamp does not blind you, its energy will inded physically blind you over time).
**lx (Lux, *Luminous Flux"*)**: The unit *Lux* is often used to represent the *"brightness*" of a lamp, or more precise: its ability to lighten up a room. So *Lux* represents the *luminous lux* of 1 *lumen* per square meter, so it is a unit to measure the level of illuminance (how brightly something gets illuminated by light). In comparison, *W/m2* expresses the energy delivered by light to a surface, regardless of light spectrum and thus regardless of the special human eye sensitivities. In short, *Lux* is *W/m2* with an adaption factor that takes into account the special nature and sensitivity of the human eye.
**Photometric Radiation Equivalent**: this is the magic conversion factor that converts *W/m2* to *Lux*. Since it incorporates the specific sensitivity of the human eye to different wave lengths, this factor is not a constant but instead depends on the light wavelength. The *Photometric Radiation Equivalent* for light with a wavelength of *555nm* (roughly the midpoint of human eye sensitivity) for example is *683lm/W*.
