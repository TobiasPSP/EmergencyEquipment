# Measuring Light Intensity

Light intensity can be measured and expressed in a variety of ways. Let's shed some light on units used to measure light.

## Units to Express Light Intensity

There are different units to represent light intensity, such as *W/m2*, *Lux* and *Lumen*. They all measure light intensity, but they do so from different perspectives. So it is important to look at the appropriate unit when trying to get an answer:

* **Energy**: If you want to set up solar panels, you are interested in the pure physical energy that sunline can deliver. Thus *W/m2* is your choice.
* **Brightness at Receiver**: If you want to buy a new lamp to illuminate your living room you are interested in how bright the room will be. Thus "Lux" is your choice.
* **Brightness at Emitter**: If you'd like to compare the brightness of different LEDs, "Lumen" is the unit of choice.

Let's take a closer look at what the different units really express:

* **W/m2 (*"Irradiance"*, Energy per Surface*)**: The unit *W/m2* is often used to represent the physical energy emitted by a light source. So W/m2 is the *rate of energy* that falls on a defined *surface*. It is mostly used in the solar industry because it expresses for example the energy of sunshine that can be captured by a solar panel. It is not so much a good indicator for *"brightness*" because it does not take into consideration wavelengths (colors) of light. Since the human eye picks up different light wavelengths in a different way (and is most sensitive to green light for example), the "felt" brightness can be much different from the actual light energy. For example, UV light may be of high energetic intensitiy (take a tan lamp) yet the human eye would "feel" this light is not very bright or even completely dark (which is in essence why you should wear eye protection when tanning because even though the UV lamp does not blind you, its energy will inded physically blind you over time).
* **lx (Lux, *Luminous Flux"*)**: The unit *Lux* is often used to represent the *"brightness*" of a lamp, or more precise: its ability to lighten up a room. So *Lux* represents the *luminous lux* of 1 *lumen* per square meter, so it is a unit to measure the level of illuminance (how brightly something gets illuminated by light). In comparison, *W/m2* expresses the energy delivered by light to a surface, regardless of light spectrum and thus regardless of the special human eye sensitivities. In short, *Lux* is *W/m2* with an adaption factor that takes into account the special nature and sensitivity of the human eye.
* **Photometric Radiation Equivalent**: this is the magic conversion factor that converts *W/m2* to *Lux*. Since it incorporates the specific sensitivity of the human eye to different wave lengths, this factor is not a constant but instead depends on the light wavelength. The *Photometric Radiation Equivalent* for light with a wavelength of *555nm* (roughly the midpoint of human eye sensitivity) for example is *683lm/W*.
* **Lumen**: The unit "Lumen" measures the *luminous flux* emitted by a lamp in all directions. In older days, the "brightness* of conventional light bulbs was conveniently expressed as *Watt*. Since conventional light bulbs all work by heating a filament, they all shared the same efficiency (or lack thereof) so the brightness could roughly be guessed by looking at the energy intake. Today with many different light technologies (that all have different efficiencies), the energy intake no longer uniformly correlates to the light output. For example, a 5W light bulb produces considerably less light than a 5W LED. That's why *Lumen* today expresses the "*brightness*" of light emitting devices. 

## Difference Between *Lux* and *Lumen*

You now know that *W/m2* ignores the specific sensitivity of the human eye and thus is not suitable for measuring "brightness". Only *Lux* and *Lumen* take into account the light wavelength and the "feeling for brightness" for the human eye.

However, what exactly *is* the difference between *Lux* and *Lumen* then?

* **Lux** (receiving light): This unit looks at the receiver of the light so it measures how bright a given surface will be when the light is shed on it. Use it to calculate the requirements for lamps for a given lighting scenario, i.e. a stage or a room in your house.
* **Lumen** (sending light): This unit looks at the sender of the light and measures the raw light output, independent of emitting angle, emitter surface, receiver surface, or distance to other objects. Use it to describe the raw *strength* of light sources.
