# Converting Energy to Brightness

Electronic devices measure plain light energy so sensor output does not necessarily correspond to subjective brightness.

In order to measure subjective brightness (*Lumen*), you need to take into consideration the specific light sensitivity of the human eye towards the light frequency you are measuring. 

Let's take at monochromatic light at first.

## Calculating Brightness of Light Color (Frequency)

To convert the (objective) energy reading from your photo sensor to a (subjective) *human* brightness, you need correction factors for the light frequency, the *Luminous Efficiency*.

### Luminous Efficiency for Different Wavelengths

The table below lists the empirical correction factors for a given light wavelength (which coincidentally resemble the light sensitivity of the human eye during daylight vision). 

This is a copy of the 1988 updated *CCIE Photopic Luminous Efficiency Function*:

### Correction Factor for Lumen Calculation

Since we really want to convert *W/m2* to *Lumen*, where do we get the *Lumen* though? Above table simply lists the sensitivities of the human eye for different light wavelengths. 

At 555 nm (the wavelength with the maximum sensitivity to the human eye), a radiant power of 1W corresponds to a luminous flux of 683 lm. Or put differently, a light with the wavelength of 555nm has a defined (constant) value of 683 lm/W. This constant is also known as *Km*.

So to convert a light energy of 1W/m2 of light of color red with 640nm, you would have to look up the specific *luminous efficiency* of that wavelength in the table above (returning a value of 0.175), then multiply it with *Km* (683 lm/W) to change the unit to *lm (Lumen): 119.525.

Here is an updated table that directly returns the correction factor for a given wavelength to convert *W/m2* to *lm/W*:

## Converting Sensor Readings to Lumens

Your electronic sensor measures light energy. We first need to convert this energy to the unit *W/m2*:

*  **Sensor Area**: since *W/m2* is energy per surface, you need the surface area of your sensor chip (the photoactive surface)
*  **Sensor Sensitivity**: you need to also know the sensitivity of your chip in *W/m2* (often other units are used such as *uW/cm2* which can be easily converted)


\- or -


* **Voltage-to-W/m2**: the chip data sheet contains tables that let you correlate the sensor output to a measured energy in *W/m2*, already taking into account the sensor specifics such as the sensor size

Next, in the table above, look up the correction factor for the light wavelength you are measuring. For example, if you are measuring the brightness of *blue* LED (450nm), the table returns a correction factor of 31.96lm/W.

Then, multiply your light energy reading from *W/m2* to *Lumen* by multiplying it with the factor you just found.

### Luminous Efficiency Function

In essence, you just used the *Luminous Efficiency Function*:

```
Xv = Xl * V(l) * Km
```

* *X1* is the light energy measured by your device, normalized to the unit *W/m2* (during the normalization outlined above, you accounted for sensor size and its specific sensitivity to light wavelengths).
* *V(l)* is the specific sensitivity of the human eye to the wavelength you are measuring (table 1)
* *Km* is a fixed constant of 683lm/W (see above for details)

Since you got Table 2 above with the ready-to-use correction factors for light wavelengths, the formula is even easier:

```
Xv = Xl * correctionFactor
```

Simply take your normalized sensor reading and multiply it with the correction factor for the wavelength you measured.
