# Calibration

Prisms and diffraction gratings can split up the visible light into distinct wavelengths.

The results need to be calibrated to assign valid wavelengths to the peaks. This is best done by using a light source with known peaks and comparing them to a measured result, then calibrating the seen peaks to the actual wavelengths that are expected.

## Flourescent Lamps

Flourescent lamps are ubiquously available and cheap. Their light shows distinct peaks from the elements used inside the lamp.

While the particular light spectrum of flourescent lamps may vary based on vendor and tolerances, the peaks will stay put as they resemble the resonance frequency of elements. Put differently, the intensity of peaks may vary but the wavelength of peaks will stay the same.

Flourescent lamp spectrums are therefore ideal for calibration since they feature a number of distinct peaks across the entire spectrum that are easily distinguishable.
