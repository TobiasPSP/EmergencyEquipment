# Labeled Light Spectrum

This is a labeled light spectrum from a flourescent lamp that can be used to calibrate spectrometers.

Flourescent lamps are ubiquously available. The light emitted will show distinct peaks from the elements used inside the lamp.

While the particular light spectrum of flourescent lamps may vary based on vendor and tolerances, the peaks will stay put as they resemble the resonance frequency of elements. Put differently, the intensity of peaks may vary but the wavelength of peaks will stay the same.

Flourescent lamp spectrums are therefore ideal for calibration since they feature a number of distinct peaks across the entire spectrum that are easily distinguishable.
## Peak Labeling

In the picture, peaks are labeled
