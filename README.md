# Emergency Equipment & Electronics

Most of my repositories are about highly specific IT stuff. This one is not. Here I can share things that I do use on my job that may still resonate with many other folks including hobbyists, fire fighters, paramedics, model makers, etc.

Part of my job are IT trainings, and part of these trainings is hardware programming and 3D prototype printing. So this repository is all about unusual emergency service hardware, hard- and software concepts, and 3D prototyping. However, this repo is just a private side show so give it some time to fill with content.

## Why (Re-)Using Emergency Equipment?

To make classes and coursework more enjoyable, I started to re-use old emergency equipment that I got from ebay & Co. It's just fun and quite sustainable for attendees to learn the principles of i.e. PWM, CAN bus, or MOSfets by getting unusual equipment to work rather than blinking and dimming a green LED.

For example, the first project I place here deals with auto-encoding emergency light patterns. It may illustrate why using this approach works extremely well for teaching hard- and software principles: detecting light pattern timings and auto-decoding patterns is by no means rocket science. It does use fundamentals in combination with creative approaches and may be useful to all kinds of folks, whether it is the entry level hardware programmer that is bored by the typical 101 examples or the model maker that has looked for emergency light timings for years to make his or her model cars look more realistic.

Cut short, I love to do things for a purpose, and my purpose here is to re-use discarded emergency light equipment for educational purposes. You are cordially invited to use the materials and/or visit the discussion forum for questions, suggestions or messages.
