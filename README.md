# Welcome

Most of my repositories are about highly specific IT stuff. This one is not and deals with side projects derived from my job as trainer and project consultant, blending in personal hobbyist interests.

What you find here are my notes while working on different ideas. This includes theory, code, data and fixed solutions.

## Project List

I'll keep an updated list of the things I do here:

* **Emergency Light Auto Pattern Detector**: My [first project](../../tree/main/Tools/Light%20Pattern%20Diagnostics/1%20Using%20OPT101%20to%20Detect%20Light) deals with auto-decoding emergency light patterns. Results may be useful for fire fighter enthusiasts as well as model makers looking to create more realistic  emergency light timings.
