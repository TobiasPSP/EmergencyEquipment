# Welcome

Most of my repositories are about highly specific IT stuff. This one is not and deals with side projects derived from my job as trainer and project consultant, blending in personal hobbyist interests.

What you find here are my notes while working on different ideas. This includes theory, code, data and fixed solutions.

## Project List

I'll keep an updated list of the things I do here:

* **Emergency Light Auto Pattern Detector**: My [first project](../../tree/main/Tools/Light%20Pattern%20Diagnostics/1%20Using%20OPT101%20to%20Detect%20Light) deals with auto-decoding emergency light patterns. It illustrates why using unusual hardware works extremely well for teaching hard- and software principles: detecting light pattern timings and auto-decoding patterns is by no means rocket science. It does use fundamentals in combination with creative approaches however. Aside from the learning aspects, the results may be useful to all kinds of folks, whether it is a hardware programmer that is getting inspiration or the model maker that has looked for emergency light timings for years to make model cars look more realistic.
