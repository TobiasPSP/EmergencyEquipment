# Emergency Equipment & Electronics

Most of my repositories are about highly specific IT stuff. This one is not. 

Here I can share things that I use on my job that may still resonate with many other folks, not necessarily IT or automation, including hobbyists, fire fighters, paramedics, model makers, etc.

Part of my job are IT trainings, and part of these trainings are hardware programming and 3D prototype printing. 

This repository is all about emergency service hardware, hard- and software concepts, and 3D prototyping. It's just a private side kick for my real job so give it some time to fill with content.

## Why (Re-)Using Emergency Equipment?

To make classes and coursework more enjoyable, I started to re-use discarded emergency equipment that I got from ebay & Co. It's fun and quite sustainable for attendees to learn principles of PWM, CAN bus, MOSfets, buck converters, etc pp by getting unusual equipment to work rather than just blinking and dimming the same old lame green LED.

The first project I place here deals with auto-encoding emergency light patterns. It illustrates why using unusual hardware works extremely well for teaching hard- and software principles: detecting light pattern timings and auto-decoding patterns is by no means rocket science. It does use fundamentals in combination with creative approaches however. Aside from the learning aspects, the results may be useful to all kinds of folks, whether it is a hardware programmer that is getting inspiration or the model maker that has looked for emergency light timings for years to make model cars look more realistic.

Cut short, I love to do things for a purpose, and my purpose here is to re-use discarded emergency light equipment for educational purposes. You are cordially invited to use the materials and/or visit the discussion forum for questions, suggestions or messages.
